# Docker image to watch a folder and HTTP POST uploaded files

This repository contains a very simple Symfony application to HTTP POST all files from
a given director that have been modified at least 30 seconds ago to a given URL, and to 
move them to an `archive` folder afterwards. And a second command to prune older files
from that archive directory.

Started from a shell script in combination with `inotify`, this can be used to do
monitor a directory exported over NFS, SMB or FTP and forward new files to some API endpoint.

## Docker Build Process

This repository has been configured [over at the Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/webfactory/hotfolder) so that
new Docker images are built automatically whenever commits are pushed.
